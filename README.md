# Harmonia
Harmonia is the novel B+ tree data-structure specifically designed for GPU to achieve high throughput for basic database operations like search, range queries etc. For more details please refer the following link.

# Motivation
B+tree is one of the most important data structures, which has been widely used in different fields such as web
indexing, database, data mining and file system but as the data size increase it puts tremendous pressures on applications
which use B+tree as index data structure. To enhance the performance of B+ tree on GPUs we use novel B+ tree data-structure which bridges the several gaps between the characteristics of GPU and B+ tree.
